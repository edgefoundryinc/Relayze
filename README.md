## 💡 Why Posthook?

**vs ngrok**: No tunneling required, works at the edge
**vs RequestBin**: Real-time WebSocket updates, not polling
**vs Webhook.site**: Open source, self-hostable, faster

## 🏗️ Architecture

Posthook uses a breakthrough pattern: **single URLs handle both POST (receive) and GET (retrieve)**
```
POST https://posthook.app/abc123  → Store webhook
GET  https://posthook.app/abc123  → Retrieve webhooks
WS   wss://posthook.app/abc123   → Real-time updates
```

This is powered by Cloudflare Durable Objects for persistent edge state.
