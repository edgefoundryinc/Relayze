## **3. How to actually respond:**

### **Bug fix PR:**
```
"Thanks for the fix! This looks good. 

Quick note: by submitting this PR you're agreeing to 
license it under BSL 1.1 (converts to Apache 2.0 after 4 years). 
Cool with that?"

[If yes] → Merge it
```

### **Feature request issue:**
```
"Interesting idea! Let me think about the architecture implications.

If you want to prototype this, feel free to fork and experiment. 
Just note the BSL 1.1 restrictions if you're planning commercial use.

For the main repo, let's discuss the approach first before you 
spend time on a PR."
```

### **Someone wants to fork and commercialize:**
```
"Hey! Posthook is BSL 1.1, so commercial use isn't permitted 
until 2029 without a separate license.

If you're interested in commercial licensing, let's talk: 
aaron@edgefoundry.com

Or you can wait 4 years for Apache 2.0 conversion 😄"
